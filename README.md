# Surfs_Up

## Overview of the Surfs Up Analysis

### Purpose

#### The purpose of this Analysis was to analysis the climate data in Hawaii to help drive the success of a local shop that sales surfboard and ice cream. Understanding the weather in different parts of the island will help determine where it would be best to choose the new location of the shop. Picking a location with less rain, warm weather and sunshine will give people a reason to want to come in and experience the store. 


### Results

#### For this changelle we looked at two separate months of data June and December. In the summer month of June, we found that the weather remained warm most of the month. There was a recorded low of 64 degrees however, 75% of the time the weather was around 77 degrees, 50% of time it was 75, 25% of time it was 73, and there was a recorded high of 85 degrees. Temperatures like this would make it great for selling ice cream in. in the winter month of December the data did change slightly. The lowest temperature was 56 degrees, that is a bit cool to want to surf in however it was found that 75% of the time the temp was around 74 degrees. 25% of the time the temperature was 69%, 50% is was 71 and max temp found was 83 degrees[1].


### Summary 

#### Overall, the weather for both months appeared to be warm. With June being a summer month, we tend to expect the weather to be warmer but for the winter month of December, even though there was some cool days the month had  an average of majority warm weather aslo.
